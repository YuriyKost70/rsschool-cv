#### About Me

*I am 51 years old. Almost all my life my work is one way or another connected with design. All my life I have been learning everything by myself and on real projects, and I think that studying combined with practical work on a real project gives the best result. I have long been interested in the field of IT, and specifically in front-end development. In my opinion, this is a combination of part of the work of a designer and an engineer. About a year ago, I myself decided to move into this field of activity and began to take steps that could bring me closer to this profession. The war in Ukraine has only accelerated this process. That's why I'm here...*
